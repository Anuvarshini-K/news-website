			<p> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic. COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. It can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face, particularly the eyes, nose, or mouth.

				<h3> No relief for Chandrababu Naidu as court orders 14-day judicial remand </h3>
				<img src="assets/chandrababu.jpeg" alt="Front Pic">
		<p> A marathon session of arguments in the ACB court in Vijayawada over former Chief Minsiter N. Chandrababu Naidu’s alleged involvement in the skill development scam ended with the III Additional District and Sessions-cum-ACB Court Judge B.S.V. Himabindu ordering on September 10 that he should be sent to judicial remand for 14 days.
			Forceful arguments were made by both sides for almost 10 hours. Additional Advocate-General P. Sudhakar Reddy represented the State/CID and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra and others argued on behalf of the former CM. The CID officials submitted a 28-page remand report to the court earlier in the day, in which he was mentioned as A-37.
			The Judge was convinced with the CID’s claim to have had prima facie evidence of Mr. Naidu’s role in the multi-crore scandal, wherein Mr. Naidu and 36 others were accused of swindling about ₹371 crore belonging to the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation in 2014-19 when TDP was in power.
		    She gave the verdict while hearing a house motion petition filed by Mr. Naidu for quashing the CID remand report on the ground that the due procedures of law had not been followed and that he was falsely implicated in the case for political gains. However, the court dismissed his plea.
		    Mr. Naidu said in his petition that the remand application filed by CID was in clear violation of Section 17-A of Prevention of Corruption Act of 1988, which mandated an enquiry into offences relatable to recommendations made/decisions taken by public servants in discharge of official duties subject to prior permission of the Governor. He made certain other averments, with which the Judge did not concur.</p>

				<h3> There are no takers for Kannada medium engineering courses in Karnataka</h3>
				<img src="assets/education.jpg"  alt="Priyanka Gandhi" width="128" height="128">
			<p>
				The response to engineering courses in the Kannada medium has been poor this year, too. In the second round of counselling for the Common Entrance Test (CET) conducted by the Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA) recently, not even one student opted for the course.
The four year B.Sc Honours course in engineering colleges launched by the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) two years ago has also elicited poor response. Only a few students have opted for the course in at the KLS Gogte Institute of Technology, Belagavi.
The State government is expected to discontinue these two courses, which were launched with the ambition of implementing the National Education Policy (NEP), sources said.

				<h3> Aditya L1 mission | ISRO successfully conducts third earth-bound manoeuvre</h3>
				<img src="assets/adhityal1.jpeg" alt="ADVERTISEMENT">
				<p>	The third Earth-bound manoeuvre of the Aditya L-1 mission to study the Sun has been performed successfully from ISTRAC, Bengaluru in the early hours of September 10.
					“The third Earth-bound manoeuvre (EBN#3) is performed successfully from ISTRAC, Bengaluru. ISRO’s ground stations at Mauritius, Bengaluru, SDSC-SHAR and Port Blair tracked the satellite during this operation,” ISRO posted on X (formerly Twitter).
					The new orbit attained is 296 km x 71767 km, the space agency said. Two more manoeuvres are scheduled to take place.  
					“The next manoeuvre  is scheduled for September 15, 2023, around 02:00 Hrs. IST,” ISRO said.
					After the final manoeuvre on September 18, Aditya-L1 undergoes a Trans-Lagrangian1 insertion manoeuvre, marking the beginning of its 110-day trajectory to the destination around the L1 Lagrange point. Upon arrival at the L1 point, another manoeuvre binds Aditya-L1 to an orbit around L1, a balanced gravitational location between the Earth and the Sun.
					The spacecraft will perform orbital manoeuvres by using its Liquid Apogee Motor (LAM) engine to reach L1.
<b>Aditya-L1</b> will stay approximately 1.5 million km away from earth, directed towards the sun, which is about 1% of the earth-sun distance. On September 2, ISRO launched India’s first solar observatory mission — Aditya-L1 from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.
On September 7 ISRO on Thursday released a selfie and images of the Earth and the Moon taken by the camera on-board Aditya-L1 solar mission spacecraft.
